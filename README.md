## RailwayReservation

A quick and simple project for college java subject.

# Setting up the project 

For now clone the project and create a postgres database named "railway" with relevant tables

run the following psql query for that 

create table userlogin ( username varchar(30) Primary key, fname varchar(30), age integer, address varchar(30), pass varchar(30) )

Any future tables that would be needed will be updated here and maybe the tables would be setup by the program itself later
