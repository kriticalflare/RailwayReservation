## RailwayReservation

A quick and simple project for college java subject.

# Setting up the project 

For now clone the project and create a postgres database named "railway" with relevant tables

run the following psql query for that 

create table userlogin (
  id integer,
  name varchar(30),
  age integer,
  address varchar(30),
  password varchar
)

Any future tables that would be needed will be updated here and maybe the tables would be setup by the program itself later
